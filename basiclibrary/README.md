# lab02

in lab02 we where tasked with making a roll method that would simulate a die rolling, a containsDuplicates to check and
see if there where any duplicates in a series of rolls,and a average method which would take the average of the rolls
given. And then make some tests for them.

# lab03
in lab03 we where tasked with making a analyzeData method that would take in an array of arrays and return min and max
values. Use a HashSet of type Integer to keep track of all the unique temperatures seen. Finally, iterate from the min
temp to the max temp and print out any temperature not seen during the month. We also had to make another method called
tally that would take in a List of Strings representing votes and return one string to show what got the most votes.
And then make some tests for them.
